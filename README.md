# Data_Prediction_Uber
This GitHub repository houses a data prediction project focused on predicting Uber demand patterns. Leveraging data science and machine learning techniques, we aim to forecast demand trends, optimize resource allocation, and enhance the overall efficiency of Uber services.

# Project Goals-
Demand Prediction: Develop models to predict Uber demand in specific locations and time periods.
Resource Optimization: Optimize driver allocation based on predicted demand to improve overall service efficiency.
Data Exploration: Utilize exploratory data analysis to gain insights into factors influencing demand.
Machine Learning Models: Implement predictive models using machine learning algorithms for accurate demand forecasting.

# Dataset-
The project uses a dataset containing historical Uber trip data, including information on time, location, and rider behavior.

# Dependencies-
Python 3,
Jupyter Notebooks,
Pandas,
Scikit-Learn,
Matplotlib,
Seaborn.
